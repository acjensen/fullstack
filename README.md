### Development

This is a private project for experimentation and learning.

I made it public so I can use GitHub actions for free ;)

#### Requirements

- NPM
- NodeJS
- Docker

#### Targets

- `npm run dev` local dev server with hot reload
- `npm run deploy` deploy to AWS

#### TODO

- Support deploying and demoing multiple branches/environments
